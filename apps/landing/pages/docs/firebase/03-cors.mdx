# CORS Settings

If you want to enable file previewing in the app, you'll have to tweak your bucket's CORS settings.  
Here's how:

1. Go to the Firebase Console, Click on `Storage` and copy your bucket's URL.

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?cloudshell=true).

1. You'll see a terminal window pop up. Click on `+` and select your project from the list.

1. First, paste this in the terminal window and press enter:

```bash
rm cors.json
echo "[ { \"origin\": [\"https://beta.firefiles.app\"], \"method\": [\"GET\"], \"maxAgeSeconds\": 3600 } ]" >> cors.json
```

4. Then replace `<your-bucket-url>` with the bucket URL you copied at step 1 and then paste this in the terminal to enable CORS for your bucket:

```bash
gsutil cors set cors.json <your-bucket-url>
```

**NOTE:** Change the `origin` URL if you are using a self-hosted Firefiles instance.

If you want to edit your CORS configuration, you can always click on the `Open Editor` button which will list your `cors.json` file in a code editor. From there, you can edit and save your changes. Once you're done, you again need to execute this command to apply your changes:  
`gsutil cors set cors.json <your-bucket-url>`
